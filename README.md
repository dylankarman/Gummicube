Sample App can be found on the iOS App Store. Sample App made a change to a marketing campaign that impacted their App Store Search channel on 10/28/20. The developer of Sample App would like to know the following: What is the impact of the 10/28/20 store change?

Understanding Traffic Sources
 When reporting performance, Apple divides the reports by channel. This includes:

App Store Search – “Customers viewed your app or tapped to download it for the first time from Search on the App Store. Includes Search Ads in App Store search.”
App Store Browse – “Customers viewed your app or tapped to download it for the first time while browsing certain sections of the App Store, including Top Charts and Categories.”
App Referrer – “Customers tapped a link in an app that brought them to your App Store product page. Includes apps that load your product page with StoreKit API.”
Web Referrer – “Customers tapped a link from a website that brought them to your App Store product page.”
Unavailable – “Source type is unavailable because customers downloaded your app prior to App Analytics tracking source attribution.”

The Search metrics show organic search and Apple Search Ads, while Browse shows the metrics from users discovering the app outside of searches. App and Web Referrer include traffic from other apps and outside websites, respectively.

Along with filtering data by channel, it’s also important to filter by territory. This way, you can narrow down how changes to a particular localization impacted that territory, without other areas grouped in.

Reported Metrics
 When tracking performance on the App Store, there are a few primary metrics reported by App Store Connect to monitor:

Impressions – “The number of times your app was viewed in the App Store for more than one second. This includes search results, Featured, Explore, Top Charts and App Product Page views.”
Product Page Views – How many times your app page was clicked on and viewed.
App Units – each first-time installer “on a device with iOS 8 or tvOS 9, or later.”
App Store Connect offers additional metrics like sales, crashes, etc. that you should monitor depending on the changes you’ve made – however, the “Impression” and “App Unit” metrics are most important when tracking your discoverability and conversion.  Impressions are a better measure of discoverability for Search, since most users will download directly from Search without tapping to view your Product Page.  Also, keep in mind that these metrics are tied to users who have never installed your app before; returning users re-installing are not counted.

Unfortunately, I cannot say whether the changes made on 10/28/2020 had any impact on their App Store Search Channel because there is not enough data. App Store Search Impressions have been trending up the previous 4 years, which suggests to me that the developers were right to strengthen their marketing campaign for where the bulk of their downloads are coming from. It seems that whatever the change was on the App Store is working but due to the fact that the App Store Search Impressions were trending up for years, and that there is a lack of data for after the change was made, I cannot say definitively that the change in the App Store is the cause of the gains in impressions, and conversely, the decrease in app units .
